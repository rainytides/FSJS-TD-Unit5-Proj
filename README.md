### **Modal Background Color Update**

The background color of the modal has been modified to `lightgray` to offer a neater appearance and ensure enhanced contrast with its content.

### **Directory Background Color Update**

The background color for the directory has been updated to `lightrose` to make the directory more aesthetically beautiful for a superior user interface.

### **Smooth Transitions Enhancement**

A refined touch has been added to the card elements and the modal container with smooth transitions. This ensures any property changes transition gracefully over a duration of 0.3 seconds.
